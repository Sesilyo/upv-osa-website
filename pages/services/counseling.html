                    <h2>Counseling</h2>
                    <p>Students are guided in making decisions about personal, vocational, and educational concerns with the help of a professional counselor. Counseling sessions are done with individual students or groups. Students are accommodated either as scheduled, walk-in, or through remote platforms.</p>
                    <p>In order to make the OSA services more accessible to the students, the Guidance Services Specialists have been assigned to the different degree programs for the students to easily identify their designated guidance counselor.</p>

                    <h2>Psychological Testing</h2>
                    <p>Data on the personal attributes of students like mental abilities. aptitudes, habits interests, and other personality characteristics are taken (face-to-face) through batteries of psychological tests given during the students' first year or as needed during their residency in the University.</p>
                    <p>Pyschological test results are also used as tools for counseling purposes.</p>

                    <h2>Career Guidance, Graduate Placement & Follow-up</h2>
                    <p>As soon as a first-year/undergraduate student enters the University, he/she is guided in identifying and developing career choices through initial interviews either as scheduled, walk-in, or through remote platforms. Career aptitudes and interests are discussed with professional Guidance Services Specialists, taking into consideration the student's pyschological test results. Follow ups are made in the subsequent counseling sessions. When they graduate, students are informed of job placement opportunities and followed up as to their career prospects. Exit interviews are requested for all students before they leave the University.</p>

                    <h2>Human Development Services</h2>
                    <p>Various groups of students are brought together in group dynamics activities and structured learning experiences where they learn to become aware of, responsive to, and effective in handling personal and interpersonal relationships. Experiences gleaned from these activities contribute to their growth and development as human beings. The Personal Effectiveness Program (PEP), a 16-hour session conducted every first semester for first year students, is one of the human development services facilitated by the Guidance Services Specialists of OSA.</p>
