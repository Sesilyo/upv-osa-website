            <h2>STUDENT ORGANIZATION & ACTIVITIES</h2>
            <p>Providing opportunities for development outside the classroom are the different student organizations and activities on campus. Coordinated by the OSA, these activities serve as venues for development of personal talents and abilities as well as leadership skills and responsibilities. Students are also exposed to various training programs such as leadership seminars and psychosocial activities. SOA also allows the students to organize and facilitate their own activities and events, which they deem relevant or integral to their academic experience in the University.</p>
